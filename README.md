# GG.deals WooCommerce Price Sync

Automatically sync your WooCommerce product prices using the latest data from [GG.deals](https://gg.deals), based on Steam App IDs. This plugin is ideal for digital goods sellers, key resellers, or gaming communities that want to stay competitive with live pricing.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Syncs prices based on Steam App IDs via GG.deals API  
- 📦 Updates `_price`, `_sale_price`, and `_regular_price` fields in WooCommerce  
- 🗂️ Logs sync events to `/wp-content/uploads/ggdeals-sync.log`  
- 🔍 Includes manual sync button in the WooCommerce admin submenu  
- 💬 Adds detailed debug logs for troubleshooting  

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Download or clone the repository to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin via **Plugins > Installed Plugins**
3. Edit your WooCommerce products and add the custom field `_steam_app_id` with the correct Steam App ID
4. Navigate to **WooCommerce > GG.deals Price Sync**
5. Click **🔄 Sync Now** to begin syncing prices

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The plugin uses the official GG.deals Prices API.
- It fetches current price data for each product with a `_steam_app_id`.
- It applies a 15% markup (by default) and updates:
  - **_price** → The current displayed price
  - **_sale_price** → Discounted price (calculated)
  - **_regular_price** → Retail price from GG.deals
